A session in this context refers to a stateful instance of interaction with our Agent for a
specific user query or workflow. Visit our Playground to get started with the Agent API. Understanding Agent Sessions Session Lifecycle Session Lifecycle: An agent session begins when you initiate it with an input URL and an instruction prompt and ends when the Agent has completed the task with the required Actions. Each session is isolated, ensuring that data and interactions are not shared across sessions. A session remains active for 10 minutes of inactivity. Use Cases: Sessions are ideal for handling individual queries, like fetching information or executing a specific task. Security: Sessions maintain high levels of security, as each agent session is fully isolated, protecting the integrity of your data and interactions. Local mode: Sessions can operate locally on your computer or remotely in the cloud. For local sessions, our server-hosted agent interacts with your Chrome browser extension. Remote sessions are fully hosted and executed in the cloud. Was this page helpful?

Gil Feig CTO at Merge.dev We used an alternative SDK generator for years, and customers constantly complained. Since adopting Fern, customers have migrated rapidly to our new SDKs and have been blown away by the quality. Steve Yazicioglu Head of Engineering at Candid Health Fern sped up new API development by at least 50%. The bits sped up are the most tedious, annoying parts. üî• Joe McKenney CTO at Dopt The sleek and modern CLI made integrating Fern into our monorepo‚Äôs versioning and publishing workflows trivial. Noah Flaherty CTO at Vellum We use Fern to autogenerate our Python and Node API clients from our OpenAPI spec. The clients are high quality, easy to update, and the Fern team moves blazing fast on feature requests. Ashley Mulligan Head of Developer Experience at Flatfile The Node.js library they produce is idiomatic and very similar to how we‚Äôd write it manually: the SDK is resource-based and Fern natively supports union types. A monumental improvement to the Flatfile developer experience versus the OpenAPI generator. Andrew Israel CEO at PropelAuth I really dislike most autogenerated code, but Fern‚Äôs genuinely feels like we have a developer writing it - would highly recommend. Nikolas Huebecker Co-founder at Onward We migrated our API and SDK to them over a weekend. They provide exceptional support! Sandeep Dinesh CTO at Mercoa We use Fern to build our API and UI elements, and couldn‚Äôt be happier! End to end type safety and client/server generation gives us the ability to move very quickly. Even better, we get great SDKs and API docs without any additional work!
